            <h3>Description</h3>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>This PC is designed to deliver high performance on all of today's most popular games without being complicated to build or costing too much. It will run well at high settings on 1080p or higher when playing Valorant, Fortnite, Minecraft, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, Apex Legends, PUBG, and more.</p>
        <h4>CPU</h4>
        <p>At this budget, we're running the Intel Raptor Lake Core i5-12600K. The 12600K features 6 Performance-cores with 12 threads, along with 4 Efficient-cores, and it will perform exceptionally well with all your gaming needs.

            For better cooling, we've included the Thermalright Peerless Assassin.
            
            If you'd prefer to consider a similar build, but instead using an AMD Ryzen processor, be sure to check out our Great AMD Gaming Build Guide.</p>
        <h4>GPU</h4>
        <p>The AMD Radeon RX 6800 will let you play all modern games at high settings with smooth fps.

            To keep the noise and temperatures down, the filter requiress a minimum number of 2 fans to avoid "blower" style cards and "mini" cards, which usually do not cool the card as well. You can choose to use this filter instead, if you want to include the smaller cards for any reason. Note that smaller cards will be louder or hotter - or both.</p>
        <h4>RAM</h4>
        <p>For RAM, we've chosen the Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB kit. It offers 2x8GB sticks of DDR4 memory with a speed of 3200MHz. This is a great choice for gaming and multitasking.</p>
        <h4>Storage</h4>
        <p>For storage, we've included the Samsung 970 EVO Plus 500GB NVMe SSD. This drive offers read speeds of up to 3500MB/s and write speeds of up to 3300MB/s. It's a great choice for your operating system and most-used programs.</p>
        <h4>PSU</h4>
        <p>We're using a parametric selection of well-reviewed units, all of which are 80+ Bronze certified or above and can provide plenty of power for this build. Note that because there are issues with PSU availability right now, some non-modular PSUs have been added to the build to help you get the parts you need. These are still high quality PSUs.</p>
        <h4>Case</h4>
        <p>The NZXT H510 is a great choice for this build. It offers a sleek design, tempered glass side panel, and plenty of room for cable management. It's a great choice for this build and offers room for future upgrades.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>This build is a great choice for anyone looking to get into PC gaming without breaking the bank. It offers great performance on today's most popular games and leaves room for future upgrades. It's a great choice for anyone looking to get into PC gaming without breaking the bank.</p>
        <h4>Price</h4>
        <p>The total price for this build is 10000Taka. This includes all of the components listed above, as well as the cost of assembly and testing. This is a great price for a high-performance gaming PC that will run well on today's most popular games.</p>
        <h4>Assembly</h4>
        <p>Assembling this PC is relatively straightforward. We recommend following a step-by-step guide or video tutorial to ensure that everything is done correctly. If you're not comfortable assembling the PC yourself, we recommend hiring a professional to do it for you.</p>
